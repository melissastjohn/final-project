                                                <p><img src="../images/Fun-Day--Night-Outfit-Ideas.jpg" width="313" height="232" alt=""/>If your plans involve hitting the latest hot spot and you value ease and comfort, a printed shift dress and smokin over-the-knee boots are effortless to put together but straight-up attention-stealing. <br>
                                                  <br>
                                                  Don&rsquo;t be afraid to mix eye-catching textures and colors for a cocktail event. We&rsquo;re totally inspired by a multicolor sequined dress paired with mirrored silver heels. Trick: Skip the metallic on the dress to avoid any matchy-matchy-ness and keep the shine to a sleek minimum.<br>
  <br>
                                                  With countless projects, so dressing to go from work to play is many women's specialty. The essential: a tweed minidress, with an interesting element, be it a bustier top or sophisticated embroidery. Layer on a blazer or cardigan by day, then strip off it off for night. Don&rsquo;t forget to stash a pair of strappy metallic heels under your desk for the post-5 P.M. switch too.<br>
  <br>
                                                  Leather will be everywhere this fall! Take a sexy, take-no-prisoners long-sleeve number by for example. And with a pair of dominatrix platform pumps no less. If you&rsquo;re looking for the ultimate date-night outfit to assure all eyes are on you, this one is it.<br>
  <br>
                                                  Seriously, the no white after Labor Day rule has become obsolete. Winter whites are huge for fall too, so try a long-sleeve jacquard top and blousy shorts. Soft gray pumps bring the look into fall without being as jarring as black. You&rsquo;ll stand out from the crowd at those September rooftop parties and chic wine-tasting nights you have planned. <br>
